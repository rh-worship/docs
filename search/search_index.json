The keys provide both rhythm, melody and \u2018bedding\u2019 for the songs. Many of the songs we play have important keys hooks/riffs that provide a 'signature' identity to the song - make sure you know these. We\u2019re blessed to have great keyboards - these contain excellent pianos, organs and an extensive synth section. These can look scary at first glance with all of their buttons and knobs, but it\u2019s quite quick to pick up the basics. Just ask if you need to have a session going through this and we can make sure that\u2019s arranged! We also use a laptop with software sounds to compliment the keyboards we use at church. Pads provide a musical bed or foundation from which the layers of the band can be added. They provide constancy and familiar warmth. They are also very helpful for transitioning between songs or in a moment of waiting to see what the Spirit is doing. With everything there is a balance, of course, so be careful not to overwhelm the sound or use too much low end which can make things sound a bit \u2018muddy\u2019. Pianos are key (pun intended) to many of the songs we play - they can bring incredibly delicate tones or punchy hammering lines. Try switching through the different types of piano on the Nord or using software - such as grand pianos, uprights, felt piano, electric grands or electric pianos/Rhodes. Organs can bring a new level of \u2018rock\u2019 with some distortion or can bring mellow, almost pad-like, bedding to a song. And of course, there are times you can rip the organ nice and proud in the more gospel-y moments! The balance between these different layers of sound is what really makes the keys stand out. Choose your sound carefully. Be attentive to what the other layers of your sounds are bringing. Particularly listen out for the electric guitar and work with them to ensure you\u2019re both adding to the sound and not overlapping or getting in each other\u2019s way.</p>"},{"location":"roles_and_skills/#skills-needed_6","title":"Skills needed","text":"<ul> <li>TODO</li> <li>TODO</li> <li>TODO</li> </ul>"},{"location":"roles_and_skills/#drums","title":"Drums","text":"<p>Drummers carry a huge responsibility within the band.

We want to play in a way that combines passion with precision to create a strong bedrock for the rest of the band to sit on whilst feeding controlled energy to the room. It\u2019s important to come to a Sunday with a strong knowledge of the original drum parts for each song on the setlist. Knowing the different grooves and patterns creates a solid foundation to add your own flair and interpretation to the songs.
