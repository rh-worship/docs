# Roles and skills

These are the various roles that make up our team, along with the skills needed for each role.

## Band

### Worship leader

Their role is to spiritually prepare and plan the song list. Have over all authority for the time of worship on Sundays. Leads and stewards the time of worship. Worship leaders are gate-keepers. They are responsible for leading the congregation vocally, spiritually as well as directing rehearsal and band alongside the MD.

### Music Director (MD)

The MD is like the glue between the backline musically and WL & vocals on the frontline. They help to direct the band dynamically to flow with where the WL is leading. The MD provides a leadership steer.

### Vocals

The vocal section of the band singing harmonies that add depth and layers to lead vocals. They are also leading and modeling physically what it means to worship.

We want our frontline vocals to add texture through harmonies and melody. Supporting the worship leaders by following their direction on how they want you to add dynamics. Be bold, confident and lead with authority. This includes leading with your body language. Whether in moments of joy and dancing or being present in quiet and intimate settings, raising hands and generally modeling worship.There is also permission to add into spontaneous moments, following the direction of the Holy Spirit. It's important to do this alongside the worship leaders, making sure everyone is on the same page.

### Eletric Guitar - Lead

Typically, the lead electric guitarist plays the opposite of chords — leads! These are melody lines (and occasionally diads and triads). You play the intro and outro lead lines. You can mimic the vocal melody or harmony lines. You can add note swells and soundscapes to create a pad-like texture to an ethereal intro or verse. Lead guitar is perfect for someone who has some experience under their belt. You need to understand all the chord changes that are being played and then be able to play the complimentary melody and harmony lines. You’ll need an amp, maybe a delay or reverb pedal, and some cables to connect them all.

### Electric Guitar - Rhythm

Just like the rhythm acoustic guitar, a rhythm electric guitarist plays the chords. You can play similar or different strum patterns than what the acoustic rhythm guitarist is playing. This adds some variety. You can also play swells and syncopated rhythms, all still with chords. Rhythm electric guitarists should be careful during an announcement or message so as to not be too aggressive or harsh and create conflict with the atmosphere. Rhythm electric guitar is perfect for someone who wants to play all the chords, rock out on the big choruses and bridges of songs, and maybe likes amps and pedals more than an acoustic guitarist. You’ll need some additional gear, including an amp and maybe an overdrive pedal — we won’t be able to hear you without some kind of amplification!

### Bass guitar

The bass connects everything in the band. We sit between the melody and rhythm and have the unique ability to subtly influence all the other instruments around us by carefully selecting where on the neck we’re going to play the root notes. Lower down the neck is essential for any peak in a song, adding power and stability to the harmony. As the band backs off for verses, we shift higher up the neck and use tasty fills and movements to announce the upcoming sections.

### Keys

Keys have a fundamental role within the band. The keys provide both rhythm, melody and ‘bedding’ for the songs. Many of the songs we play have important keys hooks/riffs that provide a 'signature' identity to the song - make sure you know these. We’re blessed to have great keyboards - these contain excellent pianos, organs and an extensive synth section. These can look scary at first glance with all of their buttons and knobs, but it’s quite quick to pick up the basics. Just ask if you need to have a session going through this and we can make sure that’s arranged! We also use a laptop with software sounds to compliment the keyboards we use at church. Pads provide a musical bed or foundation from which the layers of the band can be added. They provide constancy and familiar warmth. They are also very helpful for transitioning between songs or in a moment of waiting to see what the Spirit is doing. With everything there is a balance, of course, so be careful not to overwhelm the sound or use too much low end which can make things sound a bit ‘muddy’. Pianos are key (pun intended) to many of the songs we play - they can bring incredibly delicate tones or punchy hammering lines. Try switching through the different types of piano on the Nord or using software - such as grand pianos, uprights, felt piano, electric grands or electric pianos/Rhodes. Organs can bring a new level of ‘rock’ with some distortion or can bring mellow, almost pad-like, bedding to a song. And of course, there are times you can rip the organ nice and proud in the more gospel-y moments! The balance between these different layers of sound is what really makes the keys stand out. Choose your sound carefully. Be attentive to what the other layers of your sounds are bringing. Particularly listen out for the electric guitar and work with them to ensure you’re both adding to the sound and not overlapping or getting in each other’s way.

### Drums

Drummers carry a huge responsibility within the band. The drummer is like the thermostat of the band - the level of energy that the drummer contributes has a huge impact on the way that the rest of the band plays. We want to play in a way that combines passion with precision to create a strong bedrock for the rest of the band to sit on whilst feeding controlled energy to the room. It’s important to come to a Sunday with a strong knowledge of the original drum parts for each song on the setlist. Knowing the different grooves and patterns creates a solid foundation to add your own flair and interpretation to the songs. You will also be responsible for controlling and triggering click and backing tracks. We will provide training on how to do this if you are unaware of how the system works.
