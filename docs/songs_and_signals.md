# Songs and signals

These are the sections of a song and the signals we use to communicate which one to play and how to play it. During a service, the [MD](roles_and_skills.md#music-director-md) and the tracking guide will communicate audibly through your in-ears, while the [worship leader](roles_and_skills.md#worship-leader) will communicate non-audibly using their hands or body.

## Song sections

These are the sections that make up most of the songs we lead at RockHarbor. Whether you're on the production team or in the band, you should take the time to learn these terms.

### Vamp

If the vamp is after another section, continue to play the same chord you were previously playing. If the song starts with a vamp, in most cases play the I chord. The vamp can be as short as one bar, but may be longer.

- **Hand signal:** Hold 1 finger up
- **Body signal:** TBD

### Intro

The beginning of a song. The intro typically has a unique lead line or melody. Sometimes the intro is played between different sections in a song.

- **Hand signal:** N/A
- **Body signal:** N/A

### Instrumental

The instrumental can mean something different for every song. For some songs, the instrumental is the intro. For other songs, the instrumental is the chorus without vocals. For other songs, the instrumental is a unique chord progression and melody line played before the bridge.

- **Hand signal:** N/A
- **Body signal:** N/A

### Verse

A verse typically has a unique chord pattern and its maximum dynamic range is less than the chorus or bridge. 

- **Hand signal:** V shape
- **Body signal:** N/A

### Pre-chorus

Only some songs have pre-chorus. These sections typically have unique chord patterns and serve to build into the chorus. In a number of songs, the pre-chorus is only played after the first or second verse–not every verse in the song.

- **Hand signal:** N/A
- **Body signal:** N/A

### Chorus

The chorus typically has a unique chord pattern and has the highest dynamic range in the song. Although, in some songs, the bridge dynamic range may surpass it. In most cases, a song will end on a chorus section.

- **Hand signal:** C shape
- **Body signal:** N/A

### Bridge

The bridge typically has a unique chord pattern and has the second-highest dynamic range in the song. However, in some songs, the bridge dynamic range is the highest. Sometimes a song may end on a bridge section.

- **Hand signal:** Fingers crossed / Downwards C shape
- **Body signal:** N/A

## Signals

Signals are essentially ‘junction’ moments where we all need to be looking and aware of what’s coming up, typically the change into the next section or a new section. If we’re not all looking at these moments it’s like flying through a Stop sign without looking around.

The worship leader and MD will use the following vocal and body signals to communicate with the band during a song. Whether you're on the production team or in the band, you should take the time to learn these signals.

!!! note

    Body signals are often used instead of vocal or hand signals for worship leaders playing an instrument.

### Vamp

A full-band swell, which may be used to swell into the first measure of a song (such as in THIS), or swell into an upbeat verse after a down chorus (such as in THIS).

- **Hand signal:** N/A
- **Body signal:** N/A

### Level

The current dynamic level as a percentage. Keep in mind, the “level” does not refer to your engagement or confidence level–always remain fully engaged and confident while playing.
!!! example

    For example, 25% could sound like the first verse of [PLACEHOLDER](LINK), where 75% could sound like the second chorus before the bridge in [PLACEHOLDER](LINK).

- **Hand signal:** A hand held out to the side. For example, a hand near the waist would mean “low level,” and a hand above the shoulder would mean “high level.”
- **Body signal:** There is no signal for communicating an exact level. However, other signals can be used to communicate going up or down a level.

### Lift

Increase the current level of the song to the “next level.” This is not the same as a build. For example, if the current level is 25%, lift the dynamics to 50% and continue to play at 50% until another signal is given.

!!! example

    Hear the PLACEHOLDER in this version of [PLACEHOLDER](LINK).

- **Hand signal:** Making an “up” motion with an open hand.
- **Body signal:** Stomping a foot, or moving the guitar neck up and down repeatedly. (Not to be confused with “crash out,” where the guitar neck is held in the up position).

### Again / Loop

Play the same section of the song again at the same exact level. For example, if the current level is 75% and the chorus is being sung/played, continue to play the chorus at 75%.

- **Hand signal:** Making a looping motion with one finger.
- **Body signal:** Standing on one leg / raising a foot backwards.

### Splash pad

A mostly-cymbals/some-kick build played during a mid-song vamp.

!!! example

    Hear the splash pad after the first chorus in this version of [All Hail King Jesus](https://youtu.be/e5QMEGf4Va4?t=443).

### Build

Build the level of the song to get ready for: a full groove, drum break, or just the voices. In most cases, the level should continue to build until ~100% energy level is reached.

!!! example

    Hear the PLACEHOLDER in this version of [PLACEHOLDER](LINK).

- **Hand signal:** Air punch low?
- **Body signal:** Stomping 1 foot - start to build. Stomping 2 feet/harder stomp, go bigger. 

### Full groove

The highest energy level with the full band that is not a build. For example, the chorus after the building bridge in THIS.

- **Hand signal:** N/A
- **Body signal:** N/A

### Drum break

A high energy chorus or bridge with just the drums and vocals (and sometimes bass). In most cases, a drum break would only occur after a build.

!!! example

    Hear the PLACEHOLDER in this version of [PLACEHOLDER](LINK).

- **Hand signal:** WL point at the drummer
- **Body signal:** N/A

### Just the voices

The band’s level should be around 0% with no drums. In most cases, the pianist or guitar player should continue to “pad” behind the vocalist. However, there are times where the MD may specify to go full acapella.

- **Hand signal:** WL signals hand facing down to the whole band
- **Body signal:** N/A

### Come down

The band’s level should be around 5-10% with little-to-no drums. However, guitarists and pianists should continue to play chords in the song's default tempo.

- **Hand signal:** Making a “down” motion with an open hand.
- **Body signal:** The guitar neck is held in the “up” position, then slowly lowered a single time. 

### Crash out

A big non-rhythmic end to the song where all of the instruments are playing at ~100% with lots of symbol swells.

!!! example

    Hear the PLACEHOLDER in this version of [PLACEHOLDER](LINK).

- **Hand signal:** A fist punching the air
- **Body signal:** The guitar neck is held in the “up” position, then quickly lowered a single time and the worship leader strums hard - watch the body energy to know energy level

### Keep time

A signal specifically for the drummer. If the click has ended, the MD may ask the drummer to keep time on the cymbals / ride. In most cases, this would be after a come down or crash out, so the drummer’s level should be ~1-5% maximum.

!!! example

    Hear the PLACEHOLDER in this version of [PLACEHOLDER](LINK).

- **Hand signal:** A fist making a “drumming” motion similar to hitting the ride.
- **Body signal:** N/A

### Ending

There'll be times where we end the song as per a specified arrangement but there'll also be times where we’ll end something in a spontaneous way. This requires everyone to be looking and aware of the ‘junction’ moments.

- **Hand signal:** A fist raised in the air (but not punching like crash out)
- **Body signal:** If the WL is playing a guitar they may move the guitar up and down in a slower motion

### Next song

A signal from the worship leader to indicate they are ready to go to the next song. Typically this would take place after a time of spontaneous worship.

- **Hand signal:** Nod to MD signaling next track/click
