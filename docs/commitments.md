## Ours

We are passionate about the worship of Jesus and making Him front and center of everything. Our deepest privilege and lifeâ€™s calling is being able to lead others into His presence on and off the stage. Through musical worship and the whole of our lives.

We are committed to investing in and developing you as a lead worshiper in our church. Not just on stage but beyond that too. Our starting point and focus will be more on musical worship however it is impossible to separate it from the rest of our lives hence why there is an emphasis on being connected to the broader life of the church through a table group, course etc. We aim to hold a safe space for you to grow Spiritually and musically whilst also making space for growth and development through feedback etc.

- Coffee 1:1 with one of our leaders for new team members.
- Hosting team nights to build community.
- Role-specific teams for you to connect, share, and grow.
- Development plans for your specific role.
- 1:1 connection points throughout the year. We want to know our worship team members as best we possibly can, whilst also having a regular time and space for you to bring feedback, ideas and input to the team.

## Yours

We take the worship life of the church seriously as it is often the doorway for Kingdom activity. We ask you to consider yourself a leader and role model if you are part of the worship team. That means adhering to the leadership guidelines but also committing to pursuing Jesus and pursuing passionate worship of Him in your life.
