# Commitments

Intro paragraph...

## Ours

We are passionate about the worship of Jesus and making Him front and center of everything. Our deepest privilege and lifeâ€™s calling is being able to lead others into His presence on and off the stage. Through musical worship and the whole of our lives.

We are committed to investing in and developing you as a lead worshiper in our church. Not just on stage but beyond that too. Our starting point and focus will be more on musical worship however it is impossible to separate it from the rest of our lives hence why there is an emphasis on being connected to the broader life of the church through a table group, course etc. We aim to hold a safe space for you to grow Spiritually and musically whilst also making space for growth and development through feedback etc.

## Yours

We take the worship life of the church seriously as it is often the doorway for Kingdom activity. We ask you to consider yourself a leader and role model if you are part of the worship team. That means adhering to the leadership guidelines but also committing to pursuing Jesus and pursuing passionate worship of Him in your life.
