# Rockharbor Worship

These are the source files that make up [Rockharbor Worship](https://rockharbor-church.github.io/worship/). The site is built using [Material for MKDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Building the site locally

To view the docs preview locally, run the following commands:

```
pip install mkdocs-material
git checkout setting-up-mkdocs
mkdocs serve
```
